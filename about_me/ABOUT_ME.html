    <div align="center"><h2>My Childhood Years</h2></div>
    <div align="justify">
        <p><blockquote><dd style="color: maroon">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a great childhood is incomparable to anything, that's the time you built your memories to remember lifetime: The friends you used to play with, the friends who taught you how to play a certain games, the friends who fought back for you because there were someone who's poking you, the friends who came to your childhood birthdays. And most importantly the friends who were by your side of being a child. Those are the best of the best you could have as a child. Reminiscing my childhood years is treasure for me, I will never forget the people that were part of it. Especially my friends I used to play with, but sadly, we were no longer connected to each other. However. our memories from each will alaways live in me.
        <br><br>
        I remember the time when I was just a 7 year old kid, my father gave me a birthday present which I really loved. And then I realized, that's the most memorable and expensive gift I got when I was a kid compared to my childhood birthdays. As I remember, it was a car themed toy and and have its own track to play with. I really felt the joy I had back then. Oh, and I remember that time when my father was about to leave because he used to be a manager of Jollibee. Everytime he's about to leave, I always chase him until he got into a vehicle. I always cry and crumble that time because my father spoils me that much and he was so caring about how I feel and what am I thinking. He alaways asks me; "Ano iniisip mo nak?", "May gusto ka kainin nak?", those words are the most caring times I always hear from my father.
        <br><br>
        But of course, what about my mother, right? As many as I remember about being a mommy's boy, because my father was almost all day at his work. My mother was the one who took care of me the most. If I could recall my memories through the years of my childhood, my mother is more dominant in terms of being strict compared to my father. She always make sure I always study back then, if I don't ready at least 1 page of the reading book, she won't let me go outside to play. I admit that I was a "batang kalye" before, I used to play "pogs", "text", "jolen" and more of the those filipino "kalye" games. I also remember that time when I was reading, my mother were beside me. Because everytime I read something wrong or always say the wrong word time to time, she slaps my finger using a ruler. I cry almost everyday in my childhood years, but to be honest, that was the reason I learned to read and I'm thankful for that. My mother might be strict, but she knows that what she did on my childhood years, that's what the best she could do to me.
        <br><br>
        When I say about about my childhood friends, they are the best friends I could ever have to my childhood. I never experince getting bullied, those chrildren that time were so kindest compared to these kids nowadays. I remember the time when my uncle gave me a bike, I still don't know how to balance out my body at that time. Until such time, with the help of my friends back then, they support each side of the bicycle for me to balance it and familiarized the pedals. And they were a huge part of it why I know how to ride a bicycle. Aside from your parents teaching you what is wrong and right to do, childhood friends are there to teach you how to be a child and be one of them. It was a really overwhelming to have that kind of those friends around you as child. And it gets me upset because when I see a group of children, instead of them playing like we used before, almost all of them are just holding their mobile phones compared to what we used before. I know that it is inevitable, but I totally see what changes have been. I'm not complaining about it, besides, they may have their own way of experiences of their childhood.<sub> 35</sub></dd></blockquote></p>

    <div align="center"><h2>My Teenage Years</h2></div>
    <div align="justify">
        <p><blockquote><dd style="color: maroon">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years of surpassing my childhood days, teenage years taught me a lot of life lessons. My first time to have a crush, and yes it was fun at that time. First time I had a "kilig" sensation, the first time I did an effort for a girl. By giving her a little care like just getting her bottle refilled with water, and bought her a snacks. Yes, those things are memorable, first times are the best. Being a teenager is most great experiences I had, and I'm thankful for all the memories I had that time. It will be treasured all the time. I also remember the good times I had in my highschool years, when our teacher asked us to report and prepare for it. But that was the first time I had to report individually, I was very shy that time and I barely read out load the first sentence, because my stupid friends were laughing at the back and it made me distracted upto the point I also laugh in front of all of them. It was embarassing of course, but at that moment when I'm in front of the class, it was still a great time to have friends someone like them. At least I didn't feel alone during that time of my teenage years.
        <br><br>
        When the time we were about to finish highschool, there was sadness because most of us settled apart in seniors. But we all know that now everytime we we're in the same school because of course, we have different paths and wants in life. However, over the years have passed, we never changed. We still hang out together, have some great times all over again. And by the way, we have a friendship name that we had from our 2nd year highschool. They are "Royal Famiglia", this came up when the time of our junior prom. And oh, I remember the first time I had a dance in prom, she was my crush before. To be specific, she had a crush on me HAHA! I noticed her looking at me on our first day. While we're having orientation, she's at the left side table. I noticed her looking at me, and for the most part of it, I caught her looking straight to me. After that day, I had a friend request on facebook and it was her! We talked a lot, until got comfortable to each other. And after about months, she confessed to me that she really had a crush on me. Although, I also had a crush on her back then. She's a pretty good to be honest, and smart. She graduated valedictorian and she also do gymnast actually. Went back to the time of our junior prom, I gave her a bouquet of flowers and and liked it. I was her first dance, and she was my first dance too. It was a really memorable moment for us. However, she explained to me that we can't be more than it. She need to focus on her study, her parents are strict too so had no choice but to set apart. She's one of the best thing happened to me.
        <br><br>
        I cherish all the shared moments I had on my teenage years, mixed emotions yet it was a great rollercoaster for all of us. <sub> 32</sub>

    <div align="center"><h2>My College Years</h2></div>
    <div align="justify">
        <p><blockquote><dd style="color: maroon">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My experience of being a college for me is tough, maybe because quarantine happend at exact time of my college freshmen. I remember that time we were about to graduate on senior highschool on third week of March, but President Duterte declared the quarantine. We just graduated virtually on our seniors. But it's totally fine for me, and besides, we don't have anything to do for it. And then the here's the college years have come. First virtual learning, first year college. I don't grumble about it, but to be honest, many of us seeking those first time moments as a college student. Commuting, eating with your new friends, having great time as fresh men, coming home late becase of traffic. Well, I guess everything happens for a reason. During the time of getting into college, I had an entrance exam at Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP), but not great enough for me to get in. I was disapointed when I didn't see my name on the examinees. But luckily, I have a kindhearted parents, they didn't show disapointments just like I saw to myself before.
        <br><br>
        Until the time my parents decided to enroll me at University of the East (UE). I was hesitant at first, because the tuition fee is just eye-rolling. But my parents said they can handle it, all I just gotta do is to study and be good at it. My parents always say to me that I don't have to pressure myself eventhough I'm the eldest among my siblings. I just have to live my life and enjoy what I have, but being the eldest, I can't help to think about that someday, my parents won't be there all the time. So I have to learn to sustain myself and give them back from what I mighht become someday. I want to give the effort they always give to us. And I know being good at my college will make them proud.
        <br><br>
        Studying virtually is just ok for me at all, I'm between being extrovert and introvert, so I can cope up wuth this quarantine situation we have as of to date. Nonetheless, I crave the feeling of being a real college student. The typical day-to-day cycle of it, in spite that I already went to the UE campus to submit my credentials, I hope we could come back as much as possible from this COVID-19. <sub> 22</sub>
