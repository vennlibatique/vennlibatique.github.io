            <blockquote><blockquote><dd><p>Over the past few years of surpassing my childhood days, teenage years taught me a lot of life lessons. My first time to have a crush, and yes it was fun at that time. First time I had a "kilig" sensation, the first time I did an effort for a girl. By giving her a little care like just getting her bottle refilled with water, and bought her a snacks. Yes, those things are memorable, first times are the best. Being a teenager is most great experiences I had, and I'm thankful for all the memories I had that time. It will be treasured all the time. I also remember the good times I had in my highschool years, when our teacher asked us to report and prepare for it. But that was the first time I had to report individually, I was very shy that time and I barely read out load the first sentence, because my stupid friends were laughing at the back and it made me distracted upto the point I also laugh in front of all of them. It was embarassing of course, but at that moment when I'm in front of the class, it was still a great time to have friends someone like them. At least I didn't feel alone during that time of my teenage years.

            When the time we were about to finish highschool, there was sadness because most of us settled apart in seniors. But we all know that now everytime we we're in the same school because of course, we have different paths and wants in life. However, over the years have passed, we never changed. We still hang out together, have some great times all over again. And by the way, we have a friendship name that we had from our 2nd year highschool. They are "Royal Famiglia", this came up when the time of our junior prom. And oh, I remember the first time I had a dance in prom, she was my crush before. To be specific, she had a crush on me HAHA! I noticed her looking at me on our first day. While we're having orientation, she's at the left side table. I noticed her looking at me, and for the most part of it, I caught her looking straight to me. After that day, I had a friend request on facebook and it was her! We talked a lot, until got comfortable to each other. And after about months, she confessed to me that she really had a crush on me. Although, I also had a crush on her back then. She's a pretty good to be honest, and smart. She graduated valedictorian and she also do gymnast actually. Went back to the time of our junior prom, I gave her a bouquet of flowers and and liked it. I was her first dance, and she was my first dance too. It was a really memorable moment for us. However, she explained to me that we can't be more than it. She need to focus on her study, her parents are strict too so had no choice but to set apart. She's one of the best thing happened to me.

            I cherish all the shared moments I had on my teenage years, mixed emotions yet it was a great rollercoaster for all of us. <sub> 32</sub></p></dd></blockquote></blockquote>
