            <blockquote><blockquote><p>Independently released June 5, 2020, To Let A Good Thing Die is a resounding achievement of artistic and emotional resonance. Hailing from Northampton, British singer/songwriter Bruno Major shines as bright as a rising star can these days. He's a fully independent, world-touring artist of sound mind and clear head, committed to making art that is as much as vessel of expression for himself, as it is for others. “I’m just trying to bring happiness and warmth to people, like a warm cup of tea on a cold day,” he says.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

            <blockquote><blockquote><p>Bruno Major is the kind of artist who stays true to himself and true to his art.
            “You can say a lot in three minutes, you know,” Major tells Atwood Magazine. “None of my songs have bridges or middle-eights. I find that if I have a moment of inspiration, I follow that idea through to its natural conclusion. The words are the most important thing to me: They’re all just poems, and I decorate them with music. The vocals and stuff are all there to serve the words and make them feel more… I don’t know, believable, I guess.”</p></blockquote></blockquote>
