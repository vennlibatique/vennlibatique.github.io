            <blockquote><blockquote><dd><p>Like what I've said on my About Me, the first hands on activity. I'm that type of person who sometimes like to socialize, but sometimes, a person who only likes to stay at home. Now when I talk about my hobbies, I only have a few. I like to play basketball, go out with my friends, and watch movies whenever we want on any of our friend's house. Those kind of activities are my hobbies before the quarantine lifted. However, quarantine made me more like of an introvert person. I am now more engaged doing things virtually, like playing mobile games. But luckily, I met new friends virtually. We still don't meet though. Playing with them actually entertains me just like what I felt before.
            <br><br>
            If I ask myself about how I feel about this pandemic, they made me realized that everything could just change at anytime. Just like what we used to do with my junior high school friends. We're already 9 years of being together, I don't see them just friends, they're family. Yes, the pandemic had put us in this situation, but we're all affected by this. But the way I see my friends, it lessened our bondings, in spite that, they never changed. We still see each other and do family things we do before. Aside from they are the best, they are real. Couldn't ask for more. So yeah, hanging out with them are one the greatest hobby I have.
