		<h2>CELLPHONE</h2>
		<p>The history of mobile phones covers mobile communication devices that connect wirelessly to the public switched telephone network.
			While the transmission of speech by signal has a long history, the first devices that were wireless, mobile, and also capable of
			 connecting to the standard telephone network are much more recent. The first such devices were barely portable compared to today's 
			 compact hand-held devices, and their use was clumsy.
			Drastic changes have taken place in both the networking of wireless communication and the prevalence of its use, with smartphones 
			becoming common globally and a growing proportion of Internet access now done via mobile broadband.</p>

		<h2>COMPUTER DESKTOP</h2>
		<p>Called the “Model K” Adder because he built it on his “Kitchen” table, this simple demonstration circuit provides proof of concept for
			 applying Boolean logic to the design of computers, resulting in construction of the relay-based Model I Complex Calculator in 1939.
			  That same year in Germany, engineer Konrad Zuse built his Z2 computer, also using telephone company relays.</p>
			<br/>
		<p>David Packard and Bill Hewlett found their company in a Palo Alto, California garage. Their first product, the HP 200A Audio Oscillator,
			 rapidly became a popular piece of test equipment for engineers. Walt Disney Pictures ordered eight of the 200B model to test recording 
			 equipment and speaker systems for the 12 specially equipped theatres that showed the movie “Fantasia” in 1940.</p>

		<h2>LAPTOP</h2>
		<p>A laptop, laptop computer, or notebook computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a screen and alphanumeric keyboard.
			 Laptops typically have a clam shell form factor with the screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid and the keyboard on the inside
			  of the lower lid, although 2-in-1 PCs with a detachable keyboard are often marketed as laptops or as having a laptop mode. Laptops are
			   folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.[1] They are so named because they can be practically placed on
			    a person's lap when being used. Today, laptops are used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, for playing games,
				 web browsing, for personal multimedia, and for general home computer use..</p>
