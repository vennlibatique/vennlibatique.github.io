            <blockquote><blockquote><dd><p>To be honest, I'm just a typical person, with not that much of skills. I don't know if this is just normal but somehow, I just a normal thing. Not talking about physical activities, because I'm not that type of person that have those kind of skills. Not just because I am more of a techy, person doesn't mean I'm that kind of a nerdy person. I'm just more into a tech skills that made me naturally learn new skills about it. When talking about technology, whenever if it's hardware or software. Eventhough I still don't have experience on building a computer set up, like buy parts by parts. But I guess it's just the same, about disassemble and assemble an old computer I have, way back when I was grade school. It's so outdated, yes. But with the help of knowledge I have as of now, I can surely build a computer set up.   
            <br><br>
            In terms of my software skills, I know this is just a simple thing in I.T. I know how to install new windows OS, reformat a computer system or a laptop. I only learned it on youtube. The reaosn why I stated that here, because I remember that time when my auntie gave me a broken laptop. Then I searched it on the internet what was the problem for that particular laptop. That's when I knew it just needed to reformat, then I did it by myself. I didn't actually have a great experience using it, by the reason that it was an old laptop. And it couldn't open web browsers properly or do some basic stuffs, like run any MS offices applications. So I just stored it and never used it. My father tried to use it, because he wants to learn some basic things on MS Word. Unfortunately, It just can't handle it becase of having an old specifications of a laptop.
