            <blockquote><blockquote><dd><p>I'll keep it simple, since the pandemic it has been really affected my personality. In spite that I really love to listen music, especially OPM when it has a relaxing rhythm. I also have an interest to travel alone, go first to the wonderful places here in our country. I love playing games, fps shooter games, like Call of Duty Mobile, Player Unknown Battle Grounds mobile and more kind of those games. I also love to watch movies, almost all genres of movies. As a techy person, I love to search new updates in terms of new mobile phone trends. For example; new great mobile phone has released, I watch some reviews out of it. Eventhough I won't actually buy it. I just like to keep myself updated on new mobile phone trends. That's actually the reason why my circle of friends always asks me about like, what is a most affordable latest and and has a good specifications. Something like that.

            With this kind of situation we have, that we're quarantined and just doing most of activities are through online. I taught myself to cope with this and just do what we're interested. It's who we are, we're humans. We're capable on doing new things and adjust on what we have on our surroundings. For me, interests is just something we do day by day, and it could actually change or learn something new from the things we're interested in. For now, all that I stated above are the things I do day by day. But I know to myself that It will eventually change, the way I do on my everyday life as of to date. But overall, I love the way who I am today, and I enjoy all the things I do.
